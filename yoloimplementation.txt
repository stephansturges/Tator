YOLOv8 Integration Plan (10 steps)

Status key: [ ] pending  [x] done

1) Backend scaffolding + safe model registry
   - Add YOLO run/model roots under uploads/
   - Add run metadata helpers + prune to keep best.pt + metrics only
   - Commit: "yolo: add run storage helpers" (ed4aa63)
   Status: [x]

2) Training API skeleton
   - Endpoints: POST /yolo/train/jobs, GET /yolo/train/jobs, GET /yolo/train/jobs/{id}, POST /yolo/train/jobs/{id}/cancel
   - Create run records + stub responses (non-breaking)
   Status: [x]

3) Dataset integration + reuse rules
   - Resolve dataset from Dataset Manager (current or selected)
   - Convert to YOLO once if needed, cache by dataset_id + task
   - Avoid duplicate dataset copies per run
   Status: [x]

4) Training execution (YOLOv8 detect/segment)
   - Ultralytics YOLO().train for detect/segment
   - from-scratch vs fine-tune support
   - Save only best.pt + metrics/artifacts + labelmap
   Status: [ ]

5) Variant catalog (YOLOv8 only)
   - Supported variants: yolov8n/s/m/l/x (+ p2 variants if present)
   - Endpoint: GET /yolo/variants
   Status: [ ]

6) Augmentation controls
   - Simple, safe aug schema (flips, hsv, mosaic, mixup, crop, scale, rotate)
   - Map UI -> API -> Ultralytics args
   Status: [ ]

7) UI tab: Train YOLO
   - Dataset selector (current + saved)
   - Task detect/segment
   - Model variant dropdown (from /yolo/variants)
   - from-scratch vs fine-tune
   - Augmentation panel
   - Start/Cancel/Refresh + logs
   Status: [ ]

8) T&Cs gating
   - UI checkbox: “I have read and accept Ultralytics T&Cs”
   - Persist in localStorage; block API without acceptance
   Status: [ ]

9) Progress + graph
   - Persist progress snapshots (epoch, loss, mAP)
   - UI status + small graph/sparkline
   Status: [ ]

10) Model management + README
   - List/download/delete best.pt + metrics
   - Docs: usage, artifacts, dataset reuse, T&Cs
   Status: [ ]
