# Backend Storage Hardening Log

This log keeps implementation checkpoints out of the README front page while
preserving the exact validation story for storage and artifact-write fixes.

## 2026-05-24: SAM3 and Shared Training Split Roots

- Rejected symlink components anywhere in shared Qwen/SAM3 training split roots
  before and after root creation.
- Rejected symlink components anywhere in SAM3 training run roots and direct run
  candidates.
- Rejected symlink components anywhere in SAM3 generated config roots and config
  file paths before writing generated YAML.
- Added regressions for symlinked ancestors on SAM3 split roots, SAM3 run roots,
  SAM3 generated config roots, and Qwen split roots.
- Validation: `975 passed, 17 skipped`; live endpoint map/method checks and
  OpenAPI sanity checks passed against the restarted backend.
